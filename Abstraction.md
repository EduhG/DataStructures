<h3>What is abstraction?</h3>

<p>Abstraction in Java or Object oriented programming is a way to segregate implementation from an interface and is one of the five fundamentals of OOP.</p>

<p>Abstraction represent taking out the behavior from How exactly its implemented. Abstraction in Java is achieved by using an interface and an abstract class.</p>

<p>One example of Abstraction is creating interface to denote common behavior without specifying any details about how that behavior works e.g. You create an interface called Server which has the start() and stop() method. This is called abstraction of Server because every server should have a way to start and stop and details may differ.</p>

<p>Abstraction is used to hide certain details and only show the essential features of the object. In other words, it deals with the outside view of an object (interface).</p>

<h3>Abstraction vs Encapsulation in Java</h3>

<p>While Abstraction takes out behaviour from how it is implemented. Encapsulation hides details of implementation from the outside world so that when things change no body gets affected.</p>

<p>Abstraction is implemented in Java using interface and abstract class while Encapsulation is implemented using private, package-private and protected access modifier.</p>
